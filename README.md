I've developed a comprehensive system for managing solar plants. This includes functionalities for monitoring and controlling various aspects of solar systems, ensuring efficient management and optimization of solar energy production. Incorporated a third-party API for solar data, enabling the storage of inverter details,battery detail, generation,consumption,grid load ,backup load on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis alongside real-time data and manage battery details, including changes and energy discharge. Implemented Cron jobs to get data of plants onn specific time period Additionally, established a runtime token system with a two-minute expiration for enhanced security.
